                    <h2>Northwestern Designathon!</h2>
                    <h4>September 15th, 2020</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the past 48 hours some friends and I participated in Northwestern's Designathon, a campus-wide competition to design ways to connect students during COVID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exciting news: we were within the top 4 teams in a competition that included 41 teams and we won our pod of 9 teams!
                    </p>
                        Using a human-centered design approach, where we synthesized the "pain-points" of first-year students dealing with the lack of person-to-person connections during COVID, we identified opportunities to improve existing social media apps. Students wanted an app to develop meaningful and long-lasting connections. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With these insights, we designed Concat, a social media platform to meet new friend groups by matching students by interests and giving them tasks to do. Throughout the competition, I worked with students to gather research and design/wireframe the application. I then created a functional prototype using Swift.
                    <p>
                        I would like to thank my team: Bill Yen Andy Xu Chase Correia Matthew Schilling - y'all have been some of the most dedicated students I've met at Northwestern! I would also like to thank Shaleahk Wilson for being a great mentor and offering critical advice (even when we were up late at night). I would also like to thank the administration for organizing this event!
